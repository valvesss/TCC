# blopy

# THIS BRANCH IS BROKEN!! IM WORKING ON INT!!

Blopy is a python library that provides a full self blockchain node. It
handles P2P connections, immutable-ledger, cryptography, consensus protocol and
mining functions.

Each node runs independently until connect to other nodes in the network. As the
premise says: "if the node connected has a large chain, it adapts to it".

The application was made to run by third part, so use it with a client.
